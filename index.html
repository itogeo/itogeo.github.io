        <h2>About Ito Geospatial</h2>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial supports small agencies and municipal teams with the heavy lifting typically reserved for larger shops.
          We focus on remote sensing, elevation model cleanup, and pragmatic automation that keeps local data accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every engagement is hands-on. We work alongside staff to verify inputs, document assumptions, and leave behind tools
          and training that can stand up to public review.
