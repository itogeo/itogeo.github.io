        <h1>Practical Geospatial Support for Local Projects</h1>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial helps municipalities, watershed groups, and regional agencies make sense of their terrain and imagery.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="bio-grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            Ito Geospatial is built to support the public sector with work that holds up under review. We bring remote sensing and
            elevation expertise to teams that don't have an in-house GIS bench, helping them maintain good data, document decisions,
            and stay ahead of the next floodplain or planning cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work is intentionally straightforward: gather the best available inputs, clean and align them, and hand back
            products that real staff can maintain. When clients need field checks, model updates, or training, we stay involved
            until the data is actually useful on the ground.

          <h3>Ian Van Dusen, Founder & Principal</h3>
          <p>
            Ian leads Ito Geospatial with a decade of experience aligning advanced elevation modeling,
            floodplain analytics, and operational pipelines for teams that need answers faster than legacy
            systems can provide them. His work blends hydrologic correction, spectral feature extraction,
            and Python automation to remove the friction that often stalls geospatial initiatives.
