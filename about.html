        <h1>Practical Geospatial Support for Local Projects</h1>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial helps municipalities, watershed groups, and regional agencies make sense of terrain and imagery so every stakeholder can act on trusted data.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="bio-grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            Ito Geospatial is headquartered in Bozeman, Montana, and supports partners across the country with work that holds up under review. We bring remote sensing and elevation expertise to teams that don't have an in-house GIS bench, helping them maintain good data, document decisions, and stay ahead of the next floodplain or planning cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our projects are geared toward adoption: we convene engineers, planners, and field staff around the same geospatial source of truth, pairing clean analytics with clear story maps and meeting-ready views. When clients need field checks, model updates, or training, we stay embedded until the data is actually useful on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work is intentionally straightforward—gather the best available inputs, clean and align them, then hand back products and software pipelines that internal staff can sustain for the long haul. Every workflow we deploy is versioned, documented, and designed to survive staff turnover.

          <h3>Ian Van Dusen, Founder & Principal</h3>
          <p>
            Ian leads Ito Geospatial with a decade of experience aligning advanced elevation modeling,
            floodplain analytics, and operational pipelines for teams that need answers faster than legacy
            systems can provide them. His work blends hydrologic correction, spectral feature extraction,
            and Python automation to remove the friction that often stalls geospatial initiatives.
